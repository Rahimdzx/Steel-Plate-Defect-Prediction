Dataset DescriptionÂ¶
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Steel Plates Faults dataset from UCI. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files train.csv - the training dataset; there are 7 binary targets: Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other_Faults test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of each of the 7 binary targets sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
